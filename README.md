## Introduction
The "Medical Premium Predictor" project employs machine learning algorithms to estimate medical insurance premiums based on a comprehensive set of individual attributes. By utilizing a Random Forest Regressor model trained on a diverse dataset encompassing factors such as age, height, weight, medical history, and more, this project offers a valuable tool for both individuals seeking insurance quotes and providers looking to offer accurate pricing.

This repository encompasses the codebase, dataset, and accompanying documentation for the project. It encompasses data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis, model training, and an interactive interface for seamless premium predictions. Furthermore, the project showcases insightful visualizations, shedding light on the intricate relationships between various features and premium prices.

Contributions and feedback are highly encouraged, as they play a crucial role in refining and enhancing the capabilities of this project in the realm of healthcare and insurance. Whether for personal use or as a resource for the industry, the Medical Premium Predictor aims to make informed insurance decisions more accessible.

## Features

- Predict medical insurance premiums based on individual attributes.
- Interactive user interface for inputting feature values.
- Exploratory data analysis visualizations for insights.
- Random Forest Regressor model for accurate predictions.


## Dataset
The dataset used in this project can be found in the repo itself. It contains health-related parameters of almost 1000 customers. The premium price is in INR (â‚¹) currency and showcases prices for a whole year
## Usage
To predict a medical insurance premium, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/tanny7125/Medical-Premium-Predictor.git
```


## Result
The model's performance is evaluated using accuracy score, confusion matrix, and classification report.We are getting an accuracy of 90 percent for our model and we are able to correctly predict the income when we put the input for the different 14 paramters and our model helps to find the premium insurance.
